# HandTracking_Robot_2023
This is the my research project for 2023

## Author
Nethika Jayith Rajapakse

## Description
Now is the progression from handtracking to arm tracking.

This is the things that I'll need for the project

- Program
    - Detect angles / degress
    - Capture arm from many different veiw points
    - Calculate the force applied to the robot arm to allow it to move to the end position 

- Robot Arm
    - Able to take the numbers from the program and convert them into the arudunio
    - Sufficent power soruce for all the motors
    - Motors:
        - Six servos for the hand
        - Haven't caculated how many motors needed for the rest of the arm

- Mediapipe Documentation & OpenCV Documentation gave good tips and tricks and taught me how to run mediapipe with opencv
    - https://docs.opencv.org/4.7.0/
    - https://github.com/google/mediapipe/tree/master/docs 

- GeeksForGeeks showed me how to access features in mediapipe to figure out solutions

## Progress
Building my robot hand prototype for only tracking hands
