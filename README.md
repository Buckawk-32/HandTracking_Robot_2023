# HandTracking_Robot_2023
This is the my research project for 2023

## Author
Nethika Jayith Rajapakse

## Description
This is a prototype that I'm entering into my school's Science Fair.

This program will detect your right hand and whether your fingers are up or down and whether you hand is back hand or front hand and will display this on the camera feed. This information will be inputed into an arundio, controlling a servo controlled hand that copies your hand's movement

- Mediapipe Documentation & OpenCV Documentation gave good tips and tricks and taught me how to run mediapipe with opencv
    - https://docs.opencv.org/4.7.0/
    - https://github.com/google/mediapipe/tree/master/docs 

- GeeksForGeeks showed me how to access features in mediapipe to figure out solutions
