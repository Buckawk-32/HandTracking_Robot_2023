# HandTracking_Robot_2023
This is the my research project for 2023

## Author
Nethika Jayith Rajapakse

## Description
This is a prototype that I'm entering into my school's Science Fair.
1. Libraries
    - OpenCV
    - Mediapipe
    - MessagetoDict() from Google lib

This program will detect your right hand and whether your fingers are up or down and whether you hand is back hand or front hand and will display this on the camera feed. This information will be inputed into an arundio, controlling a servo controlled hand that copies your hand's movement

## Progress
The only part that is left is the connection to the Arudino and Arudino code for the servo hand
